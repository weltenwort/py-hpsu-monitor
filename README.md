## Background

This is intended to be deployed on a device that has a physical CAN connection
to a Rotex HPSU heating system. It polls a configurable set of registers via
the Elster-Kromschr√∂der protocol and forwards the received values via MQTT. It
has only been tested with the following models:

- Rotex HPSU compact 508

Please contribute experiences with this or other models in an [issue].

## Install

To deploy from source use [poetry] to install or build a wheel.

## Usage

The configuration file allows for parameterization of various aspects:

- the CAN connection
- the MQTT connection
- the Elster protocol registers to poll

## Contributing

I welcome requests, bug reports and PRs.

Small note: If editing the Readme, please conform to the
[standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
